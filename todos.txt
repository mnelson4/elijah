-countries-and-states-category-importer plugin: works but horrible UI.
--add shortcode for add-research-objective page
--add template
--for each piece of info's year and birth, have a checkbox saying "I have an estimate (or exact date/place)"
--when checked, years: have two inputs for a date-range;
--places: input with suggestion dropdown (suggest countries like "Canada (province/state unknown)", states like "Alberta, Canada")
--when they select a place or press enter, add it as a hidden input AND a small div
--receive the form submission, and redirect to the new research strategy.
--the two together
-record work done:
--mark items as resolved automatically according ot work done
--resolved research objectives
-item currently being researched
-restyle current-research-objective
-user registration form
-create searching page
-welcome page

---submit patches:
----YARPP_Core: see commit 2c5a889c32a7433d6de4
--when clicking on a research strategy, keep window of previous research objective, and a mini window for entering details and checkboxing it. When done, return to research objective
